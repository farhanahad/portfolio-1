    <h4>Welcome to Farhan's Area</h4>
    <p><b>I'm Farhan. I'm a 2nd year student of ICT Department at Comilla University.In the first year of varsity life, I was focused on problem solving with C language, but after getting up in the 2nd year, I started focusing on web developing. After doing the LEDP program, I hope my skill will develop a lot more than before</b></p>
